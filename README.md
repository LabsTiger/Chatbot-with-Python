# Chatbot-with-Python
### A Chatbot with python that can be trained on user Input
## How it works:
It primarly uses Python to run the code and json to store the data!
3 functions that are created are the load_data, save_data and get_response
#### Load data:
The functions opens the json file in read mode and it loads the json file contents
#### Save data:
It opens the file as an editable file which can be the edited thru out the code
#### Get Response:
If the quesion is in the data it returns the data
#### main:
Consists of the main logic!

Please read the license if you are going to use this for anything and rememeber to put the license in the programm!
